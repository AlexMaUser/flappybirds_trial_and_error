# flappybirds_trial_and_error
It's my first experience coding an entire game in python. 
The spawn pipes have a bugg, but mainly, because the pygame module has a different xOy coordinates system and sometimes the bottom pipes spawn upside down.
Also the resolution of the game is smaller because my monitor it's kinda smaller and was a pain to code in higher resolution.
